This tutorial focuses on quantifying taxonomic diversity across scales (alpha, beta, and gamma diversity sensu [Whittaker 1960](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/1943563)). In addition, you will use the knowledge gained in tutorials 1 and 2 to calculate [Hill numbers](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1934352?seq=1) of order *q* (i.e. the effective number of species for a given diversity order *q* ) and plot diversity profiles to analyse and compare biodiversity between different sites in a hypothetical metacommunity. Particular attention will be paid to the importance of sampling effort when comparing biodiversity estimates between sites with different levels of biodiversity.\n\nThere are R packages that allow you to calculate all the diversity measures listed above, but we will not be using them in this tutorial. We would like you to write your own R code to calculate them. Once again, it's all about learning by doing.\n\nLet's get started!\n\n## A hypothetical metacommunity\n\nThe first step is to create some data to work with. You will do this by sampling wooden meeples (which are small board game pieces) to generate a site by species abundance matrix. Our hypothetical metacommunity consists of six paper bags (which represent different sampling sites), each containing 30 meeples (which represent different individuals living at a site). Meeples of the same colour belong to the same species. We will not give you any information about species diversity and composition at each site. You will have to obtain this information yourself, by repeatedly sampling each site without looking inside the bags.\n\nOur species pool consists of 10 different species, each represented by a different colour. This is a small species pool, but it is enough to meet the objectives of this tutorial.\n\n![](Colors_meeples.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"850\"}\n\n## Sampling procedure\n\nThe aim of this exercise is to simulate a survey carried out to characterise the taxonomic diversity of six sites making up our metacommunity. Each site will be sampled multiple times to simulate surveys in a number of quadrats/locations at each site.\n\nYou can start generating biodiversity data using the following procedure:\n\n1.  Divide into 6 sub-groups.\n\n2.  Each sub-group takes one bag (each bag is labelled with a number from 1 to 6). The bags have a different composition and contain a different number of species.\n\n3.  One member of each a sub-group carefully mixes the content of the bag and randomly samples 6 individuals from the bag (this represents 20% of the individuals in a bag). Try not to look inside the bag to avoid any sampling bias.\n\n4.  Write down your observations in an Excel sheet (site as rows, species as columns).\n\n5.  Once your observations have been recorded, put your sample back into the bag and give the bag to another person in your group. Then, repeat the previous steps until you have three replicates. In your data sheet, report your observations independently for each replicate (i.e., each row in your data is a replicate within a site).\n\n6.  Once you have all the replicates needed for your bag, switch bags with another group and repeat the previous steps. Do this until you have three replicates for at least four different bags. Note that all the calculations below are based on six bags, but you can also do the same calculations with four bags (you will get different answers).\n\n7.  Make sure that your data are formatted properly.\n\n## Exercises\n\n### Load R packages\n\nLoad *tidyverse*, *knitr*, and *viridis*.\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: true\n#| echo: true\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(viridis)\n```\n\n### Exercise 1: Calculate the average species richness at each site\n\nUse what you learned in previous tutorials to calculate the average number of species at each site.

You can do this manually, but we also want you to be able to do this in R! The functions `pivot_longer()`, `group_by()`, and `summarise()` are essential for this purpose.\n\nFirst, import your data into R. Then, use knowledge from tutorials 1 and 2 to write R code to calculate alpha, beta, and gamma diversity in our metacommunity.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Solution (gamma)\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: true\n#| echo: true\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\ngamma <- as.numeric(data |> \n                      pivot_longer(Red:Black,\n                                   names_to = \"Species\",\n                                   values_to = \"Abundance\") |> \n                      group_by(Species) |> \n                      summarise(Abundance = sum(Abundance)) |> \n                      summarise(Gamma = sum(Abundance > 0)))\n```\n\nGamma diversity: `r gamma`\n\n## Solution (alpha)\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: true\n#| echo: true\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\nalpha <- round(as.numeric(data |> \n                            pivot_longer(Red:Black,\n                                         names_to = \"Species\",\n                                         values_to = \"Abundance\") |> \n                            group_by(Bag, Species) |> \n                            summarise(Abundance = sum(Abundance)) |> \n                            group_by(Bag) |>\n                            summarise(Alpha = sum(Abundance > 0)) |> \n                            summarise(Alpha = mean(Alpha))), 1)\n```\n\nAlpha diversity: `r alpha`\n\n## Solution (beta)\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: true\n#| echo: true\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\nbeta <- round(gamma/alpha, 1)\n```\n\nBeta diversity: `r beta`\n:::\n\n### Exercise 3: Calculate the effective number of species (Hill numbers)\n\nIn a community consisting of *n* species, the Hill number (or effective number of species) of order *q* can be calculated using @eq-hill-1 ($q \\geq 0$, $q\\neq1$) and @eq-hill-2 ($q=1$), where *p~i~* is the relative abundance of species *i* in the community ($p_i \\in [0,1]$).\n\n$$ ^qD = (\\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_i^q)^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}  $$ {#eq-hill-1}\n\n$$ ^1D=exp(-\\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_i\\log p_i) $$ {#eq-hill-2}\n\nUse @eq-hill-1 and @eq-hill-2 to calculate the effective number of species of order 0 (species richness), 1 (Hill-Shannon, the exponential of Shannon's entropy) and 2 (Hill-Simpson, the inverse of Simpson's concentration index) at each site of our hypothetical metacommunity. Plot your results in a figure with 6 panels (one panel for each site). For each site, plot the effective number of species as a function of *q* (this is called a diversity profile plot). Plot separate lines (using `geom_line()`) for each replicate (the `group` argument in `aes()` will be useful here).\n\nWhat do you observe? What can you conclude about the taxonomic diversity at each site?\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Solution (code)\n\nYour code should include the following steps (use the pipe!):\n\n1.  Create a new variable (called \"Total\") by summing the number of individuals of each species sampled for each replicate. Use `mutate()` to do this.\n2.  Transform all absolute species abundance values into relative abundance values by dividing the number of individuals of a species by the total number of individuals (\"Total\") sampled for each replicate. You can also use `mutate()` to do this.\n3.  Use `pivot_longer()` to reorganise the dataset and create a column called \"Species\" to store all the species names (e.g. Red, Orange, etc.) and a column called \"Abundance\" to store the relative abundance values of the species in the communities.\n4.  Filter the data to eliminate all rows where the relative abundance of a species is zero. You can use `filter()` to do this.\n5.  For each replicate, use @eq-hill-1 and @eq-hill-2 to calculate the effective number of species at q=0 (name this variable \"q0\"), q=1 (name this variable \"q1\"), and q=2 (name this variable \"q2\"). You can do this using `group_by()` and `summarise()`.\n6.  Use `pivot_longer()` to reorganise the dataset and create a column called \"q\" to store all diversity order values (0, 1, and 2) and a column called \"diversity\" to store the effective number of species in each community. In `pivot_longer()`, you will need to use two extra arguments: `names_prefix = \"q\"` (this will make sure to remove the letter \"q\" from \"q0\", \"q1\", and \"q2\") and `names_transform = as.numeric` (to convert \"0\", \"1\" and \"2\" into numeric values).\n7.  Finally, transform the contents of the \"Bag\" column by adding the string \"Bag \" (do not forget the space!) in front of the bag number (for example, converting 1 to \"Bag 1\"), and ensure that the Replicate variable is considered a factor. You can perform all these transformations using `mutate()`, `paste()` and `as.factor()`.\n8.  Finally, use *gggplot2* to plot your results in a figure with 6 panels (one panel for each site). For each site (1 site = 1 bag), plot the effective number of species as a function of *q* (this is called a diversity profile plot). Plot separate lines (using `geom_line()`) for each replicate (the `group` argument in `aes()` will be useful here). Personalise your plot to make it look nice! Be sure to apply the data visualisation principles discussed in the last lecture and tutorial.\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: true\n#| echo: true\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\n#Organise data to create the plot\n\ndata_plot <- data |> \n          mutate(Total = Red+Orange+Yellow+Green+Blue+Purple+Pink+White+Grey+Black) |> \n          mutate(Red=Red/Total,\n                 Orange=Orange/Total,\n                 Yellow=Yellow/Total,\n                 Green=Green/Total,\n                 Blue=Blue/Total,\n                 Purple=Purple/Total,\n                 Pink=Pink/Total,\n                 White=White/Total,\n                 Grey=Grey/Total,\n                 Black=Black/Total) |> \n          pivot_longer(Red:Black,\n                       names_to = \"Species\",\n                       values_to = \"Abundance\") |> \n          filter(Abundance!=0) |> \n          group_by(Bag, Replicate) |> \n          summarise(q0=sum(Abundance^0)^(1/(1-0)),\n                    q1=exp(-sum(Abundance*log(Abundance))),\n                    q2=sum(Abundance^2)^(1/(1-2))) |> \n          pivot_longer(q0:q2,\n                       names_to = \"q\",\n                       names_prefix = \"q\",\n                       names_transform = as.numeric,\n                       values_to = \"diversity\") |>\n          mutate(Bag=paste(\"Bag \", Bag, sep=\"\"),\n                 Replicate=as.factor(Replicate)) \n\n#Plot data\n\nplot <- ggplot(data_plot,\n               aes(x = q,\n                   y = diversity,\n                   group = Replicate,\n                   colour=Replicate))+\n            geom_line()+\n            geom_point(shape=16)+\n            facet_wrap(~Bag)+\n            theme_bw()+\n            xlab(\"Diversity order (q)\")+\n            ylab(\"Effective number of species (D)\")+\n            scale_colour_viridis(discrete=TRUE)+\n            theme(axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t=10)),\n                  axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r=10)),\n                  axis.text = element_text(colour=\"black\"),\n                  panel.grid.minor = element_blank())+\n            scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(0,1,2),\n                               limits = c(0,2))+\n            scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(from = 0,\n                                          to = 10,\n                                          by = 2),\n                               limits=c(0,10))\n```\n\n## Solution (plot)\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: true\n#| echo: true\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n#| fig-align: center\n\nplot\n```\n:::\n\n## Suggested further reading\n\nOur tutorial can't cover everything, and there's still a lot to learn about quantifying biodiversity!

You can do this manually, but we also want you to be able to do this in R! The functions `pivot_longer()`, `group_by()`, and `summarise()` are essential for this purpose.\n\nFirst, import your data into R. Then, use knowledge from tutorials 1 and 2 to write R code to calculate alpha, beta, and gamma diversity in our metacommunity.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Solution (gamma)\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: true\n#| echo: true\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\ngamma <- as.numeric(data |> \n                      pivot_longer(Red:Black,\n                                   names_to = \"Species\",\n                                   values_to = \"Abundance\") |> \n                      group_by(Species) |> \n                      summarise(Abundance = sum(Abundance)) |> \n                      summarise(Gamma = sum(Abundance > 0)))\n```\n\nGamma diversity: `r gamma`\n\n## Solution (alpha)\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: true\n#| echo: true\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\nalpha <- round(as.numeric(data |> \n                            pivot_longer(Red:Black,\n                                         names_to = \"Species\",\n                                         values_to = \"Abundance\") |> \n                            group_by(Bag, Species) |> \n                            summarise(Abundance = sum(Abundance)) |> \n                            group_by(Bag) |>\n                            summarise(Alpha = sum(Abundance > 0)) |> \n                            summarise(Alpha = mean(Alpha))), 1)\n```\n\nAlpha diversity: `r alpha`\n\n## Solution (beta)\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: true\n#| echo: true\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\nbeta <- round(gamma/alpha, 1)\n```\n\nBeta diversity: `r beta`\n:::\n\n### Exercise 3: Calculate the effective number of species (Hill numbers)\n\nIn a community consisting of *n* species, the Hill number (or effective number of species) of order *q* can be calculated using @eq-hill-1 ($q \\geq 0$, $q\\neq1$) and @eq-hill-2 ($q=1$), where *p~i~* is the relative abundance of species *i* in the community ($p_i \\in [0,1]$).\n\n$$ ^qD = (\\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_i^q)^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}  $$ {#eq-hill-1}\n\n$$ ^1D=exp(-\\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_i\\log p_i) $$ {#eq-hill-2}\n\nUse @eq-hill-1 and @eq-hill-2 to calculate the effective number of species of order 0 (species richness), 1 (Hill-Shannon, the exponential of Shannon's entropy) and 2 (Hill-Simpson, the inverse of Simpson's concentration index) at each site of our hypothetical metacommunity. Plot your results in a figure with 6 panels (one panel for each site). For each site, plot the effective number of species as a function of *q* (this is called a diversity profile plot). Plot separate lines (using `geom_line()`) for each replicate (the `group` argument in `aes()` will be useful here).\n\nWhat do you observe? What can you conclude about the taxonomic diversity at each site?\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Solution (code)\n\nYour code should include the following steps (use the pipe!):\n\n1.  Create a new variable (called \"Total\") by summing the number of individuals of each species sampled for each replicate. Use `mutate()` to do this.\n2.  Transform all absolute species abundance values into relative abundance values by dividing the number of individuals of a species by the total number of individuals (\"Total\") sampled for each replicate. You can also use `mutate()` to do this.\n3.  Use `pivot_longer()` to reorganise the dataset and create a column called \"Species\" to store all the species names (e.g. Red, Orange, etc.) and a column called \"Abundance\" to store the relative abundance values of the species in the communities.\n4.  Filter the data to eliminate all rows where the relative abundance of a species is zero. You can use `filter()` to do this.\n5.  For each replicate, use @eq-hill-1 and @eq-hill-2 to calculate the effective number of species at q=0 (name this variable \"q0\"), q=1 (name this variable \"q1\"), and q=2 (name this variable \"q2\"). You can do this using `group_by()` and `summarise()`.\n6.  Use `pivot_longer()` to reorganise the dataset and create a column called \"q\" to store all diversity order values (0, 1, and 2) and a column called \"diversity\" to store the effective number of species in each community. In `pivot_longer()`, you will need to use two extra arguments: `names_prefix = \"q\"` (this will make sure to remove the letter \"q\" from \"q0\", \"q1\", and \"q2\") and `names_transform = as.numeric` (to convert \"0\", \"1\" and \"2\" into numeric values).\n7.  Finally, transform the contents of the \"Bag\" column by adding the string \"Bag \" (do not forget the space!) in front of the bag number (for example, converting 1 to \"Bag 1\"), and ensure that the Replicate variable is considered a factor. You can perform all these transformations using `mutate()`, `paste()` and `as.factor()`.\n8.  Finally, use *gggplot2* to plot your results in a figure with 6 panels (one panel for each site). For each site (1 site = 1 bag), plot the effective number of species as a function of *q* (this is called a diversity profile plot). Plot separate lines (using `geom_line()`) for each replicate (the `group` argument in `aes()` will be useful here). Personalise your plot to make it look nice! Be sure to apply the data visualisation principles discussed in the last lecture and tutorial.\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: true\n#| echo: true\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\n#Organise data to create the plot\n\ndata_plot <- data |> \n          mutate(Total = Red+Orange+Yellow+Green+Blue+Purple+Pink+White+Grey+Black) |> \n          mutate(Red=Red/Total,\n                 Orange=Orange/Total,\n                 Yellow=Yellow/Total,\n                 Green=Green/Total,\n                 Blue=Blue/Total,\n                 Purple=Purple/Total,\n                 Pink=Pink/Total,\n                 White=White/Total,\n                 Grey=Grey/Total,\n                 Black=Black/Total) |> \n          pivot_longer(Red:Black,\n                       names_to = \"Species\",\n                       values_to = \"Abundance\") |> \n          filter(Abundance!=0) |> \n          group_by(Bag, Replicate) |> \n          summarise(q0=sum(Abundance^0)^(1/(1-0)),\n                    q1=exp(-sum(Abundance*log(Abundance))),\n                    q2=sum(Abundance^2)^(1/(1-2))) |> \n          pivot_longer(q0:q2,\n                       names_to = \"q\",\n                       names_prefix = \"q\",\n                       names_transform = as.numeric,\n                       values_to = \"diversity\") |>\n          mutate(Bag=paste(\"Bag \", Bag, sep=\"\"),\n                 Replicate=as.factor(Replicate)) \n\n#Plot data\n\nplot <- ggplot(data_plot,\n               aes(x = q,\n                   y = diversity,\n                   group = Replicate,\n                   colour=Replicate))+\n            geom_line()+\n            geom_point(shape=16)+\n            facet_wrap(~Bag)+\n            theme_bw()+\n            xlab(\"Diversity order (q)\")+\n            ylab(\"Effective number of species (D)\")+\n            scale_colour_viridis(discrete=TRUE)+\n            theme(axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t=10)),\n                  axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r=10)),\n                  axis.text = element_text(colour=\"black\"),\n                  panel.grid.minor = element_blank())+\n            scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(0,1,2),\n                               limits = c(0,2))+\n            scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(from = 0,\n                                          to = 10,\n                                          by = 2),\n                               limits=c(0,10))\n```\n\n## Solution (plot)\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: true\n#| echo: true\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n#| fig-align: center\n\nplot\n```\n:::\n\n## Suggested further reading\n\nOur tutorial can't cover everything, and there's still a lot to learn about quantifying biodiversity!
