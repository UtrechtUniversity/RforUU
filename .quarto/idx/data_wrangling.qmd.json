This tutorial is all about mastering these fundamental skills!\n\nLet's start by getting to know the data we are going to work with a little better...\n\n## Ecological field data used in this tutorial\n\nIn this tutorial, we will import, tidy and transform data collected between 2020 and 2023 as part of a grassland field experiment located in Germany. This section will provide you with more information about the aims and design of this experiment, as well as what has been measured in the field by the researchers who have been actively working on this experiment since 2020.

This knowledge is important because it can help us to better predict the results of restoration efforts (year effects), but also to better understand how manipulating the order of arrival of species can help us to steer the trajectory of plant communities towards desired states (priority effects).\n\n### Design of the POEM experiment\n\nThe researchers set up the same experiment manipulating the order of arrival of species at the same experimental site, but in two consecutive years. This means that one experiment was set up in 2020, while the other was set up in 2021. Both experiments test the same order of arrival scenarios. Therefore, the POEM experiment has two main fixed factors:\n\n**Factor 1**: *The order of arrival of plant species*. This factor has 5 different levels:\n\n-   Synchronous (**S**): all plant species are sown simultaneously\n-   Forbs sown first (**F**): forb species are sown 6 weeks before grasses and legumes\n-   Grasses sown first (**G**): grass species are sown 6 weeks before forbs and legumes\n-   Legumes sown first (**L**): legume species are sown 6 weeks before forbs and grasses\n-   Free succession (**B**): no species are sown in these plots\n\n**Factor 2**: *The year of initiation of an experiment*. This factor has 2 levels:\n\n-   **2020** if the experiment was set up in 2020\n-   **2021** if the experiment was set up in 2021\n\nThe experiment consists of 50 experimental plots, with 5 replicates per factor combination.\n\n![POEM experiment in June 2021 (Niederhaverbeck, Germany).

There are a number of ways to do this depending on the input file format.
