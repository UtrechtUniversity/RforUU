We hope you will find it a useful tool for learning data science in R and working on your course assignments.\n\nThe effectiveness of our tutorials lies in their practical approach. Instead of quickly scrolling down our tutorials and simply reading R code, we encourage you to actively use it and to take the time to understand what each function does. Even if you find learning R difficult at first, don't give up and just keep learning at the pace that suits you. Learning R is exactly like learning a new language. At first, you can only write and speak short, simple sentences, but with regular practice, you will soon be able to write and understand the language fluently. The best way to learn R is by practicing it and reusing the same commands over and over again.\n\nNow get ready to improve your data science skills. Let's get started!\n\n## R for Data Science\n\nOur tutorials heavily rely on the **R for Data Science** book (second edition) written by Hadley Wickham, Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel, Garrett Grolemund, and many other contributors. To freely access the content of this book, just click on its cover. Thank you to the authors of this book for creating such a gold mine of infoRmation. Due to the time constraints of our course, it is unfortunately not possible to go through all of the techniques and R code described in this data science book, but we strongly encourage you to explore its content and continue to learn new skills. In the tutorials, we will often refer to specific sections of the book if you wish to dive deeper into certain topics.\n\n[![](Cover_R_for_Data_Science.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"200\"}](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo make the best out of these tutorials, you will need to install three things on your computer: R, RStudio, and a collection of R packages called *tidyverse*. If other R packages are needed, we will always mention them at the beginning of each tutorial.\n\n### Step 1: Installing R\n\nYou can download R for Linux, macOS, or Windows on the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/). CRAN is an abbreviation for the Comprehensive R Archive Network.\n\n### Step 2: Installing RStudio\n\nRStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R (and other languages such as Python) developed by [Posit](https://posit.co/), an open-source data science company. We highly recommend using RStudio, which will make your experience of working with R much more enjoyable. With RStudio, you can easily write your own scripts, run R code, manage your workspace, install and load R packages, view graphical output, and much more! You can download RStudio on the [Posit website](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/).\n\n### Step 3: Installing *tidyverse*\n\n[*tidyverse*](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a collection of R packages for data science. When installing *tidyverse*, you will install a suite of R packages that are very commonly used when processing and visualising data, such as *readr*, *dyplr*, *tibble*, *ggplot2*, and more! After opening RStudio, you can install *tidyverse* by executing the following code in your R console:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n```\n:::\n",
